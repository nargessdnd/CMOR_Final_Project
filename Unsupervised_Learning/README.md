# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Dataset Usage

These algorithms are applied to the ESG and Financial Performance dataset (or a separate image dataset for SVD) within the main `ESG_Financial_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Reproducing Results

Refer to the `ESG_Financial_Analysis.ipynb` notebook for details on data preprocessing, model training/application, and results analysis using these implementations.
